# AI Optimization Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of **Hill Climbing** and **Genetic Algorithms** in Python.  
The project was developed as part of a university course on **Artificial Intelligence**.  
All tasks are based on optimization problems: function minimization, path planning, and investment allocation.
